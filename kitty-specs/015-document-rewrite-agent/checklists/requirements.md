# Specification Quality Checklist: Document Rewrite Agent

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is ready for `/spec-kitty.clarify` or `/spec-kitty.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear user scenarios with independent testability
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable success criteria focused on outcomes
- Technology-agnostic requirements
- Well-defined error handling scenarios

The specification successfully addresses the user's need for automated document rewriting based on debate conclusions while maintaining clarity on business outcomes rather than technical implementation.
